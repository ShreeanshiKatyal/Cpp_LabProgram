Overview

This project is a C++ based Railway Management System designed to simulate the core operations of railway booking and management. It falls under the domain of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Application-based System Design. The program demonstrates real-world concepts like train scheduling, passenger management, ticket booking, and fare calculation, while also making use of OOP principles such as inheritance, constructors, friend functions, operator overloading, and static members.

Features

Train Management

Add and display train details (train ID, name, route, distance, duration).

Combine two train objects using operator overloading (+) to create a joint service.

Calculate average speed of a train using a friend function.

Passenger Management

Add passenger details (name, age, from, to).

Auto seat allocation using a static seat counter.

Automatic PNR generation for each passenger.

Ticket Management

Book tickets with class selection (AC/Sleeper).

Calculate fare dynamically based on travel class and distance.

Display ticket details with confirmation status.

Program Flow

User specifies the number of passengers.

Menu-driven interface allows:

Adding train details.

Adding passenger(s).

Displaying train and passenger details.

Booking and displaying tickets.

Combining train objects and checking average speed.

Exiting the program.
